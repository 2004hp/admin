# API Platform Admin

**This project is an early stage. It's actually a Proof of Concept.
It is highly experimental and will be fully rewritten.
Use it at your own risk.**

Generate automatically an admin interface for any API built with [API Platform](https://api-platform.com)
or exposing a [Hydra](http://hydra-cg.com) documentation.

The admin is generated using the awesome [ng-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/ng-admin) library.

# Features
